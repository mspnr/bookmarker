# Extension Icons

Please add the following icon files to this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These icons will be displayed in:
- Browser toolbar (16x16, 48x48)
- Extension management page (128x128)
- Firefox Add-ons manager

You can create simple bookmark-themed icons (e.g., a bookmark ribbon or star icon).

For now, the extension will work without icons, but Firefox will show a warning during installation.
